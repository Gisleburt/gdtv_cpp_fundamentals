GameDevTV C++ Fundamentals
==========================

This is my repository for the [GameDevTV C++ Fundamentals](https://www.gamedev.tv/courses/1216775) course.

You will need to download and install [RayLib](https://raylib.com), then copy/move the folder into this one (its
.gitignore'd).

Each numbered folder can be opened as a VSCode workspace, use Terminal -> Run Build Task... to create the executable.
